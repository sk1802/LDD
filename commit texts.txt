mhi: ep: Fix ring element addition by updating read pointer after write sync  

Currently, the read pointer (rd_offset) is incremented before writing the  
element to the ring via write_sync(). This can cause race conditions where  
the hardware or another entity might see an updated read pointer before  
the element is actually written, leading to potential inconsistencies.  

This change ensures that the ring element is first written via write_sync(),  
and only after a successful write, the read pointer is updated.
